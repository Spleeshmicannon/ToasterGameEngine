# ToasterGameEngine
The Toaster Game Engine aims to allow game creators to, while using programming interfaces that 
echo that of unity and unreal, make games that have been stripped down to their core components. 
Games that will not only run on toasters, but run fast and run well on them. The targets at the 
moment are windows and linux, with Apple Mac support potentially coming in the future.

## Kohi
I will mention here that alot of my design decisions and the general structure of the engine are either
heavily influenced or almost copied from the Kohi Game Engine. It is written in C though, while this is in
C++ so there are some major differences. 

Travis Vroman, the creator of Kohi, has a youtube channel where 
he has video tutorials going through each component in the engine, you can find it here:
